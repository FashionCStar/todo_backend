# Todo List Application

This is a simple full-stack Todo List application built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The backend uses an in-memory array to store tasks, and the frontend interacts with it via RESTful API calls.


## Running the Application

### Backend Setup

npm install

#### Create a .env file with the following variables:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/todoapp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret


npm start

The app will now run at http://localhost:5000.
